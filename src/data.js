So much so that you don't want to necessarily introduce that standard 808 drum machine...it's not going to add anything to the sound. At this point it's almost ignorable as a stand in for an actual beat. These are far better."</em> -

    byLine: 'by Mike',
    contentHTML: `Yesterday, UUUE self-released a new project, the <em>Psychic Dollhouse EP</em>, which sees the band working with shorter, more contained songs. Although the release is only five songs and about 18 minutes long, the band traverses a wide variety of sonic terrain and mood, which ranges from mellow on "Morris on Morris", to sinister on "Andromeda". This is another solid release from the band that showcases improved songwriting in this writer's humble opinion. They're hoping to have another full-length released by the end of the year and play some live shows as soon as the music scene is revived.

    <p>Unfortunately, the recording of uuue's performance was lost because of technical issues, but below is the performance of Noise Nomads, who's industrial and glitchy drone was sure to have caused a stir in the quiet neighborhood.</p>
