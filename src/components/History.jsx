          Greetings, I was recently asked to write about the history of Spooky
          Tree for our new website. I think the releases are the real story of
          the label, and they speak for themselves. You can read a little about
          them in the releases section. I did want to take this opportunity to
          thank everyone involved over the years, because without their
          involvement Spooky Tree would have never come about.

          The seed was planted in 1994. I was living in Boston with my cousin
          Greg, we came up with idea to do a record label, and we ran with it.
          As time went on, the label became inactive for a few years, resurfaced
          for a while, back on hiatus, and slowly back again. I think I'm a very
          lucky person to have some really talented friends that play music. The
          goal of the label has always been to document really good obscure
          music and get it in the hands of people who appreciate it.

          As far as my thank yous, I'd like to thank all the bands for putting
          out music on the label. Great bunch of people, truly a honor and
          privilege. Greg Stukuls for starting the label and being the main
          force. Brenden Rule for so much support in so many ways. Derek Stukuls
          for all of his art. Dan Friel for tons of help over the years. Dave
          Geist for helping the second wave of the label get going. Craig
          "T-Bone" Johnson for constant support. Mike Roberts for building this
          new website, and to whoever I'm forgetting as I write this, I
          apologize. There's just too many people to list, but I know who you
          are, much love.
        </p>
        <p>There will be new releases coming out soon, so stay tuned.</p>
